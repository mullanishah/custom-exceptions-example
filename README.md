# custom-exceptions-example
This task is intended to exercise custom exceptions in Java by creating a simple application with a bank ATM features. 

An assignment/task/example illustrating applications of custom exceptions in Java by mimicking features of banking and basic ATM machines in such way that exceptions would be thrown in case of invalid or incorrect operation is requested to be performed.

In layman's term, an exception is an abnormal condition that arises in code sequence and disturbs or interrupts normal flow of program execution. Whereas, the exception handling mechanism in Java helps programmers and JVM to recognize and handle events or situations that would cause exceptions in such way that the normal flow of application can be maintained. 

Also, Java provides us facility to create our own exceptions which are basically derived classes of the Exception class (java.lang.Exception). Such exceptions can be thrown in case of custom or user need and commonly referred as Custom exceptions or User-defined exceptions.
